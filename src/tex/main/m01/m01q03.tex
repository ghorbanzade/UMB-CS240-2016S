\section*{Question 3}

Write a function \texttt{int single\_number(int array[], int size)} that accepts a non-empty array of integers \texttt{array} with size \texttt{size} whose elements appear twice expect for a single element.
Your function should return the element that appears only once.
Following are test cases that clarify the objective.

\begin{terminal}
[1, -1, 4, 5, 4, 1, -1] -> 5
[1, 2, 3, 3, 2] -> 1
[1] -> 1
\end{terminal}
