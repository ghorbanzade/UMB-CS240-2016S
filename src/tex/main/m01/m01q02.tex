\section*{Question 2}

Edgar Linton, a CS240 student, was asked to write a program that promps user for an integer and prints it on the screen.
A sample run of the program was expected to be as given below.

\begin{terminal}
$ gcc prompt-number.c -o prompt-number
$ ./prompt-number
enter number: 125
number: 125
\end{terminal}

To solve this problem, he wrote the following program.

\lstset{language=c,tabsize=4}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=10]{\resDirectory/prompt-number-q.c}

His program produces the following output.

\begin{terminal}
$ gcc prompt-number.c -o prompt-number
$ ./prompt-number
enter number: 125
number: 971397989
\end{terminal}

Clearly, something is wrong with Edgar's code.
This is why he is asking for your help to debug his program and fix all its bugs.
Rewrite the program \texttt{prompt-number.c} such that its output matches the expected output provided previously.
