\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item
Line 7 replaces address of \texttt{Hello} memory block with address of \texttt{World!} memory block.
Standard output will be \texttt{World! World!}.

\item
Every iteration of \texttt{while} loop in line 8, shifts value of \texttt{num} variable one bit to the right.
Standard output will be \texttt{16 8 4 2 1}.

\item
Recursive calls to function \texttt{func} produces 5 entries in the function call stack.
Output will be printed from last function call to the first.
Standard output will be \texttt{5 4 3 2 1}.

\item
Both functions \texttt{func1} and \texttt{func2} modify the value they are passed to and do not affect variables declared in \texttt{main} function.
Standard output will be \texttt{World! World!}.
\end{enumerate}
