\section*{Question 5}

The following structure is defined to implement a resizable array of integers.

\lstset{language=c,tabsize=4}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=20,lastline=24]{\resDirectory/array-list.h}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a function with the following signature that returns value of element $e_{i}$ of the array $A$ where $i$ is the element index.

\lstinputlisting[firstline=28,lastline=28,numbers=none]{\resDirectory/array-list.h}

\item Write a function with the following signature that updates value of element $e_{i}$ of the array $A$ with a given value $v$, where $i$ is the index..
The function is expected to return previous value of $e_{i}$.

\lstinputlisting[firstline=29,lastline=29,numbers=none]{\resDirectory/array-list.h}
\end{enumerate}
