\section*{Question 3 (Optional)}

Write a shell script \texttt{random-sorted-array.sh} that generates three positive random integers (less than 20) and passes them to the \texttt{array-generate} program, developed in Question 1.
The shell script should then pipe the ouput of \texttt{array-generate} as standard input to \texttt{array-sort} program, developed in Question 2.

The desired output of the shell script is given below.

\begin{terminal}
$ ls
array-generate array-sort random-sorted-array.sh
$ chmod 755 random-sorted-array.sh
$ ./random-sorted-array.sh
30 30 32 32 33 34 35 35 37 38
$ ./random-sorted-array.sh
7 7 7 8 8 9 10
\end{terminal}
