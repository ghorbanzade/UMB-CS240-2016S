\section*{Question 2}

Write a program \texttt{array-sort.c} that takes an arbitrary number of integers as command line arguments and prints the array in ascending order randomly choosing of the \texttt{bubble-sort}, \texttt{insertion-sort} or \texttt{selection-sort} algorithms.

\begin{terminal}
$ ls
array-sort.c array-sort.h array-utils.c array-utils.h
$ gcc -c -o array-utils.o array-utils.c
$ gcc -c -o array-sort.o array-sort.c
$ gcc -o array-sort array-sort.o array-utils.o -Werror -Wall -std=gnu99 -I.
$ ./array-sort 34 35 32 38 32 30 33 35 37 30
30 30 32 32 33 34 35 35 37 38
$
\end{terminal}
