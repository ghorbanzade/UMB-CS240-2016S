\section*{Question 1}

Write a program \texttt{array-generate.c} that takes command line arguments $n$, $m_1$ and $m_2$ and gives as output an array of $n$ integers with values between $m_1$ inclusive and $m_2$ exclusive in random order.

Following is an expected sample run of the program:

\begin{terminal}
$ ls
array-generate.c array-generate.h
$ gcc array-generate.c -o array-generate
$ ./array-generate 10 30 40
34 35 32 38 32 30 33 35 37 30
$ ./array-generate 5 0 10
5 2 8 9 8
\end{terminal}
