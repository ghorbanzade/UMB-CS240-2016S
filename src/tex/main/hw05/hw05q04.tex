\section*{Question 4}

Building source code for questions 1 and 2 of this assignment requires initiating multiple commands.
To simplify the build procedure and render the process less error-prone, write a \texttt{Makefile} that summarizes the build procedure as follows.

\begin{terminal}
$ make clean
rm -rf ./array-generate ./array-sort
find . -name '*.o' -delete
$ ls
array-generate.c array-generate.h array-sort.c array-sort.h
array-utils.c array-utils.h random-sorted-array.sh
$ make
gcc -c -o array-generate.o array-generate.c
gcc -c -o array-utils.o array-utils.c
gcc -o array-generate array-generate.o array-utils.o -Werror -Wall -std=gnu99 -I.
gcc -c -o array-sort.o array-sort.c
gcc -o array-sort array-sort.o array-utils.o -Werror -Wall -std=gnu99 -I.
$ ./random-sorted-array.sh
5 12 16 17 17 19 20
\end{terminal}
