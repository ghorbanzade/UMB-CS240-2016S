\section*{Question 1}

To check whether a given non-negative integer $n$ is a prime, it suffices to check if it is divisible by at least one of the elements in $\mathbb{S}_n =  \{ k_i \in \mathbb{P} | k_i < \sqrt{n} \}$.
If $\mathbb{S}_n$ is known, it takes $|\mathbb{S}_n|$ operations to check for primality of $n$.
This is much better than when $\mathbb{S}_n$ is not known in which case it takes $\mathbb{O}(n \log \log n)$ operations to construct it.

Suppose we can store $\mathbb{P} = \mathbb{S}_n$, as set of all \textit{known} prime numbers, in a file and access it when testing primality of another non-negative integer $m$.
This way, if $1 << m < n$, primality testing of $m$ would be trivial.
On the other hand, if $1 << n < m$, $\mathbb{S}_n$ would still be very useful in constructing $\mathbb{S}_m$ and required operations for prime-checking $m$ will be reduced by $c_1 n \log \log n + c_2$ operations where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are positive integers.
In this case, once $m$ is prime-checked, we can update the list of \textit{known} prime numbers to $\mathbb{S}_m$ for later use.

You are asked to write a program \texttt{fast-prime.c} that accepts a set of non-negative integer numbers as command line arguments and, using the above-mentioned algorithm, checks for their primality.

You may not include any header file other than \texttt{fast-prime.h}.
In addition, your \texttt{fast-prime.c} file should accompany a \texttt{Makefile} to facilitate building process and artifact removal.

Following illustrates the expected functionality of your program.
