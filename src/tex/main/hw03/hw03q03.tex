\section*{Question 3}

Write a program \texttt{prime.c} that prints a prime number $n_i$ where $i$ is a positive integer and $n_1 = 2$ and prompts the user whether to print the subsequent prime number.
The program continues to print $n_{i+1}$ as long as the user enters \texttt{Y} or \texttt{y}.
The program terminates when the user enters \texttt{N} or \texttt{n}.

Expected output of a sample run of your program is shown below.

\begin{terminal}
$ gcc prime.c -o prime
$ ./prime
2
another prime [y/n]? Y
3
another prime [y/n]? y
5
another prime [y/n]? YyY
7
another prime [y/n]? t
invalid input.
another prime [y/n]? n
\end{terminal}
