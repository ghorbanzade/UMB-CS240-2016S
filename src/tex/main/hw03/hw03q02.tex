\section*{Question 2}

Write a program \texttt{reverse.c} that takes an integer number as a command-line argument and prints its reverse.

Your program is expected to function as shown below.

\begin{terminal}
$ gcc reverse.c -o reverse
$ ./reverse
error: missing command line argument
$ ./reverse 12345
Reverse: 54321
$ ./reverse -54321
Reverse: -12345
$ ./reverse hello
error: not a number
$ ./reverse 1234 5678 hello
Reverse: 4321
\end{terminal}
