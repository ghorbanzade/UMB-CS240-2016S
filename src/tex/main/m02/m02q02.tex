\section*{Question 2}

Bellatrix Lestrange, a CS240 student, was asked to write a program that takes an arbitrary number of non-negative integers as command line arguments and prints their average.
A sample run of the program was expected to be as given below.

\begin{terminal}
$ gcc command-line.c -o command-line
$ ./command-line
error: missing command line arguments
$ ./command-line 2 5 8
5.00
$ ./command-line 1 2 3 4 5 6
3.50
\end{terminal}

To solve this problem, she wrote the following program.

\lstset{language=c,tabsize=4}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=10]{\resDirectory/command-line-q.c}

Her program produces the following output.

\begin{terminal}
$ gcc command-line.c -o command-line
$ ./command-line
-15202348.00
$ ./command-line 2 5 8
-1147083.00
$ ./command-line 1 2 3 4 5 6
-12761818.00
\end{terminal}

Clearly, something is wrong with Bellatrix's code.
This is why she is asking for your help to debug her program and fix all its bugs.
Rewrite the program \texttt{command-line.c} such that its output matches the expected output provided previously.
