\section*{Question 1}

You are asked to test a \texttt{hello-world.c} program on the Unix system of the CS department.
The following commands have already been executed.

\begin{terminal}
you@yourmachine:~$ ssh you@users.cs.umb.edu
you@users.cs.umb.edu password:
you@itserver6:~$ pwd
/home/you
you@itserver6:~$ ls
cs240
you@itserver6:~$ ls cs240
hw01 hw02 hw03 hello-world.c
\end{terminal}

The objective is to put the \texttt{hello-world.c} file in a new directory with full path \texttt{/home/you/cs240/m01}, display its content and compile and execute it.
Finally, you should remove the produced object file and the binary files.

List all unix commands that you need to issue to fulfill this objective.
