\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Every instance of variable \texttt{num} should have been dereferenced.
\lstset{language=c,tabsize=4}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=18,lastline=35]{\resDirectory/str2int.c}

\item
Function \texttt{rand()} returns a number between 0 to \texttt{MAX\_RAND} which is at least 32767.
\texttt{rand() \% 10} should have been used instead.
\lstset{language=c,tabsize=4}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=17,lastline=23]{\resDirectory/populate.c}


\item
\texttt{while} loop should terminate once character \texttt{\textbackslash 0} is encountered.
\lstset{language=c,tabsize=4}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=16,lastline=25]{\resDirectory/palindrome.c}

\end{enumerate}
