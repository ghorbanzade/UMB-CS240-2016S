\section*{Question 4}

Fleur Delacour had been asked in her take-home CS240 exam to write a program that will take names, gpa and graduation year of the students of Beauxbatons College and computes average gpa of their class of 2016.

Fleur has decided to define a C structure that encloses information for each student.
She is planning to write a function that takes student information and returns a student structure.
This way, she can create an array of student structures and pass it to another function which will compute gpa of any given class.
Since she is runnning out of time, you are asked to help implement her idea.

\begin{itemize}
\item Define a structure \texttt{student} that can hold required information for a given student.
\item Write a function that takes data of a student and returns an initialized student structure.
\item Write a function that takes an array of student structures and a class year and returns average \textit{gpa} of students graduating in that given year.
\end{itemize}
