\section*{Question 3}

Building source code for questions 1 and 2 of this assignment requires initiating multiple commands.
To simplify the build procedure and render the process less error-prone, write a \texttt{Makefile} that summarizes the build procedure as follows.

\begin{terminal}
$ make clean
rm -rf ./fruit-basket ./slow-prime
find . -name '*.o' -delete
$ ls
fruit-basket.c fruit-basket.h Makefile slow-prime.c
slow-prime.h
$ make
gcc -c -o fruit-basket.o fruit-basket.c
gcc -o fruit-basket fruit-basket.o -Wall -std=gnu99 -I.
gcc -c -o slow-prime.o slow-prime.c
gcc -o slow-prime slow-prime.o -Werror -Wall -std=gnu99 -I.
$ ls
fruit-basket fruit-basket.c fruit-basket.h fruit-basket.o
Makefile     slow-prime     slow-prime.c   slow-prime.h
slow-prime.o
\end{terminal}
