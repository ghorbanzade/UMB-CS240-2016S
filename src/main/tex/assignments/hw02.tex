\section*{Question 1}

Write a program \texttt{uppercase.c} that takes an arbitrary number of command line arguments and prints them all in uppercase.
Following examples illustrate how your program is expected to function.

\begin{terminal}
$ gcc uppercase.c -o uppercase
$ ./uppercase the taste of life was sweet
THE TASTE OF LIFE WAS SWEET
$ ./uppercase as rain upon my tongue
AS RAIN UPON MY TONGUE
$ ./uppercase
error: missing command line arguments
\end{terminal}

\section*{Question 2}

Write a program \texttt{hexa.c} that takes a string in form of a command line argument and prints values of its characters in hexadecimal system.

Following is the expected output of a sample run of your program.

\begin{terminal}
$ gcc hexa.c -o hexa
$ ./hexa Boston
42 6f 73 74 6f 6e
$ ./hexa Quincy Boston
51 75 69 6e 63 79
$ ./hexa
error: missing command line argument
\end{terminal}

\section*{Question 3}

Write a program \texttt{sequence.c} that without using the multiply operator \texttt{*}, prints numbers $n = 2^{i}-1$ where $0 \leq i \leq 64$ separated by a single space.
